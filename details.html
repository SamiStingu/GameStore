            <h2>About</h2>
            <h4>A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1] Games are different from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).

                Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. A toy and a game are not the same. Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.
                
                Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role.
                
                Attested as early as 2600 BC,[2][3] games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures. The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.[4]</h3>

        <div class="ratings">
            <h2>Ratings</h2>
            Video games can be subject to national and international content rating requirements. Like with film content ratings, video game ratings 
            typing identify the target age group that the national or regional ratings board believes is appropriate for the player, ranging from all-ages, 
            to a teenager-or-older, to mature, to the infrequent adult-only games. Most content review is based on the level of violence, both in the type of violence and how 
            graphic it may be represented, and sexual content, but other themes such as drug and alcohol use and gambling that can influence children may also be identified. A primary 
            identifier based on a minimum age is used by nearly all systems, along with additional descriptors to identify specific content that players and parents should be aware of.

        <div class="platform">
            <h2>Platform</h2>
            ideo games require a platform, a specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware and associated software,
             to operate.[32] The term system is also commonly used. Games are typically designed to be played on one or a limited number of 
             platforms, and exclusivity to a platform is used as a competitive edge in the video game market.[33] However, games may be developed for
              alternative platforms than intended, which are described as ports or conversions. These also may be remasters - where most of the original game's 
              source code is reused and art assets, models, and game levels are updated for 
            modern systems - and remakes, where in addition to asset improvements, significant reworking of the original game and possibly from scratch is performed.[34]
